# ðŸ’¸ Discount Calculator

This Python script allows users to calculate the final price of an item after applying a discount. If the discount percentage is **20% or more**, the discount is applied; otherwise, the original price is returned.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

- Simple command-line interface.
- Calculates final price based on user input.
- Automatically applies discount if it's 20% or higher.
- Provides formatted output with two decimal places.

## ðŸ§® How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter:
   - The **original price** of the item.
   - The **discount percentage**.
2. The script checks if the discount is at least 20%.
3. If it is, the discount is applied and the final price is shown.
4. If it isn't, the original price is displayed (no discount applied).
