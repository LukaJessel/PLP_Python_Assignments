# Python List Operations Example

This repository contains a simple Python script demonstrating basic list operations such as creating a list, appending items, inserting values, extending lists, removing elements, sorting, and finding an element's index.

## Code Overview

The script performs the following steps:

1. Creates an empty list called `my_list`.
2. Appends the elements `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40` to the list.
3. Inserts the value `15` at the second position (index 1) in the list.
4. Extends `my_list` with another list: `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. Removes the last element from the list.
6. Sorts the list in ascending order.
7. Finds and prints the index of the value `30` in the list.

# How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Python script with:

bash
python your_script_name.py

Replace your_script_name.py with the actual filename of the script.

You should see the index of the value 30 printed to the console.
