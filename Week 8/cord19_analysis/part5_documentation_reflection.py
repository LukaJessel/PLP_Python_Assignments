CORD-19 Data Analysis Project - Reflection
=========================================

Findings:
---------
- The dataset contains diverse metadata about COVID-19 research papers.
- Most papers were published in 2020 and 2021, with a peak in 2020.
- Top journals include well-known medical and scientific publishers.
- Titles frequently contain terms like 'covid', 'coronavirus', and 'pandemic'.
- Abstract word counts vary widely, indicating differences in paper detail.

Challenges:
-----------
- Handling missing values in key columns (e.g., journal, abstract).
- Converting date columns with inconsistent formats.
- Visualizing data with limited sample size (1000 entries).
- Ensuring compatibility of scripts and visualizations across environments.

Learnings:
----------
- Importance of data cleaning before analysis.
- Value of visualizations for uncovering trends.
- Streamlit enables rapid development of interactive data apps.
- Modular scripting improves workflow and debugging.

Next Steps:
-----------
- Apply analysis to the full dataset for deeper insights.
- Explore advanced NLP techniques for abstracts and titles.
- Enhance the Streamlit app with more interactivity and filtering.
